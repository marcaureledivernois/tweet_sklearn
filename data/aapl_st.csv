"traderfirstyear- more $aapl commentary and end of the economic cycle predictions. from a few months ago. more documentation etc $qqq $dia $spy - massive fiscal response of 2 trillion stimulus package, on top of qe would likely in the next 8 to 14 months have a positive impact on consumption. although, it creates a 3 trillion dollar deficit this fiscal year, which is heavily tilted towards consumption and not investment, which is going to do serious damage to the long run potential growth rates of the us economy. the us needs full tax overhaul with a progressive consumption (vat) tax phased in over 5 years, substantial investment in human capital, research, and infrastructure over a 10 to 20 year horizon. all of this is needed for us to remain competitive in 21st century. imo 

last point 3 trillion in dissavings ar the federal level while everyone else pursues similiar policies globally is going to result in expanding the us current account deficit (for consumption = not good) 😔"

"it’ll be interesting to see what the reaction is to the “marshall plan” stimulus. on the one hand, yes we are bailing out companies and that should be a positive. 
on the other, it has to be questioned how effective a stimulus is when everything will continue to be shutdown for another month or two. it doesn’t really save the airline employees if the airlines remain empty. in fact it’s like burning/throwing cash at the problem. 

additionally, when i was studying the marshall plan in an advanced course on international economic theory, economists genuinely questioned whether the marshall plan was actually effective. i will have to dig out my old textbook on it and show the statistics.

agreement on the stimulus package might spark a rebound, but nothing the feds have done have had any substantial effect.  
 
another potential negative catalysts are national lockdown or inter-state flight ban to prevent spread and sudden surges in other regions like thailand and hong kong and other asian countries. potential positive catalysts are better effects from the malaria cocktail and slow downs in europe or ny.  
 
all the money pumped from feds to banks have been going into actual hands of people and businesses. the whole world is out of work and needs pay right now. so, it is unclear if we get a big relief rally any time soon. i would expect max 240, or just 227."
