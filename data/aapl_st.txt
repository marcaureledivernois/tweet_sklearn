charlie munger said something that stuck with me for awhile. he said last year that 2008 was a fluke; meaning the fed got lucky reinflating asset bubbles. and he said it won&#39;t work in the next crisis. this got me seriously thinking this might all not work. the destruction of dollars in the system is going to be large even for the fed to get money velocity going again. who is looking to take on more debt right now with 3mil about to hit unemployment this week. this will continue for months as shutdowns persist and grow around the country. i really hope the fed can pull it off. i feel like the longer it takes, the greater the odds this does spiral into a  depression. $qqq $aapl $msft $spy
